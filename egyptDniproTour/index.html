                        Picture yourself gliding along a deep reef wall covered in brightly colored soft and hard corals. The visibility is 100+ ft, the temperature is 78 degrees, and the current is virtually non-existent. The chance of spotting whale sharks, turtles, hammerheads, and mantas is high.Where are you diving? You’re in the Red Sea, of course!Lucky Egypt has been blessed with 2 coastlines, the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The northern, Mediterranean coastline is home to the ruins of the ancient Alexandrian lighthouse, and the Red Sea boasts some of the most spectacular reef systems in the world. Divers have been drawn to Egyptian waters since the very beginnings of SCUBA diving. In fact, Jacques Cousteau was so impressed by the bounty he found underwater here that he attempted to make a submerged village in the southern Red Sea. The waters in the Red Sea are teeming with a biodiversity rarely seen elsewhere. With more than 1,200 species of fish, pelagic life, dugongs, and vividly colored corals that are unrivaled across the world, it’s easy to see why the Red Sea remains a bucket-list trip for divers. It doesn’t hurt that diving here is remarkably affordable too.

Regarding excursions milies with children, it is worth paying attention to various sea trips, the show "1001 Nights".
